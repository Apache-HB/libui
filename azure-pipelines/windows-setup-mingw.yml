    # apparently they didn't think to add this functionality from the start (multiple joins was only added in PowerShell 6 and Azure Pipelines is using 5.x), and the direct-CLR approach actually behaves differently (and I would need to check which version of .net Azure Pipelines is using anyway, since our use case isn't one of those cases where it behaves differently)
