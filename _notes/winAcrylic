[16:28:47]  <+andlabs>  oh, so the acrylic effect in windows 10 uwp IS open source now after all
[16:29:05]  <+andlabs>  and I bet most of it is possible in non-UWP apps with DirectComposition and Direct2D
[16:29:46]  <+andlabs>  the only problem left is Get(Host)BackgroundBrush(), which are not in the open-source components and are still uWP only, and are how the actual content to blend with is grabbed

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2670838/platform-update-for-windows-7-sp1-and-windows-server-2008-r2-sp1 oh, directcomposition isn't part of the windows 7 platform update, so it's a hard win8 only :|

I guess I can use DwmEnableBlurBehindWindow on the older platforms...

Pietro Gagliardi, [19.05.19 00:54]
won't work for blur-behind window-content, only blur-behind everything-underneath-the-window
